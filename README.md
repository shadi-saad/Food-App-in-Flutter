Food Delivery App (Flutter Project)
This project is a full-fledged food delivery app built with Flutter, a cross-platform framework. It caters to three distinct user roles:

Users: They can browse nearby restaurants, explore menus, place orders with a user-friendly interface.
Restaurants: Restaurant owners can manage their profiles, upload and modify menus, receive new order notifications with details.
Delivery Personnel: Delivery staff can accept orders from restaurants, track their assigned deliveries, and update delivery status for user information.
